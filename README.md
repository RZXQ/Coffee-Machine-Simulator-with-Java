# Java Coffee Machine Simulator

Have you ever wondered how a coffee machine works? This project will walk you through the wonderful world of beverages machines by letting you program a coffee machine simulator in Java.

## About The Project

The project simulates a coffee machine. It works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups. If it runs out of something, it shows a notification. This simulator allows you to make three types of coffee:
- Espresso
- Latte
- Cappuccino

The machine has several states:
- Choosing an action
- Choosing a type of coffee

## How it Works

The machine takes a string as input and determines how to interpret this line using the information about the state of the coffee machine. Depending on the input, the state can change or remain the same. The class does not use system input at all; it only handles the input that comes to it via its string method.

## Why This Project

This project provides hands-on experience with Java and OOP. It offers to practice working with methods, loops, conditions, classes, class methods and attributes, and enhances your understanding about how electronic devices work in real life.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you can just start your Java Development Environment and run the project.
